### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about solving challenges combining the technical and human aspects to delight the customers with high quality products. 
By creating (test) strategies, processes, tools and organizations to provide fast feedback which enables organizations to quickly adapt and change the product.
Fostering a culture of respect, collaboration, empowerment, and innovation is majorly important to me.
